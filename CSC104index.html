           In this course, students will explore both historical approaches for AI, as well as the major subfields and applications of AI today. These include using AI in intelligent devices, machine learning, voice recognition, APIs, and libraries for these implementations. Students will then apply that knowledge to create their own fully functioning AI applications.
